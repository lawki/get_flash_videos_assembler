# Flash Videos Downloader
**This program uses get_flash_videos available on Ubuntu**. This program can be used to create a bash file which can download videos from the flash based video websites. This can also be replaced by utility like youtube-dl.
It is for automating the download from flash based websites. It's not the only solution to download videos, but its better in ragards as
#### Less data used
 because you don't acuatlly have to play the video in order to download it, unlike in the case of download helper plugin for firefox making the double work.
#### Time saving
 It's not going to download faster than some download manager, but your time will be saved from playing the video and putting them to download one by one. You can just put all the links in one txt file and download them with a simple command.
